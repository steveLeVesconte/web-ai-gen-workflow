            <div class="project-content">
                <p>The purpose of this project is to provide an adequately rich problem domain for the exploration of multiple technologies. In my experience, a developer really does not learn a technology until they apply it to a project not contemplated by the writers of textbooks and tutorials.</p>

                <h2>What is a "Go Game"?</h2>
                <p>"Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day." Source: Wikipedia</p>

                <img src="https://picsum.photos/800/400" alt="Go Game Pieces" class="article-image">
                <p class="caption">Go Game stones on a wooden board.</p>

                <h2>Comparing Go To Chess</h2>
                <p>Like Chess, Go is a two person board game where chance plays no role in deciding the outcome of the game. Both games have steep learning curves and players can spend decades improving their skills.</p>

                <p>That said, an argument can be made that Go is considerably more difficult for computer algorithms to "learn" and it has proven to be more difficult for computers to compete with master Go players.</p>

                <h2>The Go Game for Two Players as a React Responsive Web Application</h2>
                <p>Below is the responsive view as seen on a wide desktop.</p>

                <p>And here is the responsive view on a smart phone.</p>

                <h2>Features of the Project</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firebase Authentication - SAML and generic OpenID Connect - (Google)</li>
                    <li>Registering new users</li>
                    <li>Users can create new matches by choosing opponents and stone colors</li>
                    <li>Users can choose among available matches in progress</li>
                    <li>Users can place stones (move) when it is their turn or pass</li>
                    <li>The most recent move is marked with move number (see '100' in the images)</li>
                    <li>Users are prompted to confirm moves and passes</li>
                    <li>Users can live-chat while playing a Go Game</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2>Try it right now!</h2>
                    <p>Note, this button will open React Go Game in a new browser tab. You can login as one of the "test users" provided on the login page and play the game. You can, if you like, compete against a friend, if they also open this link on their computer or phone.</p>
                    <a href="#" class="btn-primary">Click here to login and play Go against a friend</a>

                <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
                <p>This project provides the following opportunities for continuous improvement.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add Semantic Versioning Tags to Git Repository</li>
                    <li>Improve Unit Test Coverage</li>
                    <li>Code review looking for opportunities to improve (I will find plenty)</li>
                    <li>User Documentation and Help including Go Game rules</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Future Forks (planned major revisions and new versions)</h2>
                <p>An adequately rich problem domain project can be re-used to exercise more skillsets. The following are the future plans for this project.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace the Firebase API with AWS Serverless Lambdas backed by DynamoDB</li>
                    <li>Host the Go Game in an AWS EC2 instance and/or Dockerize with AWS Fargate</li>
                    <li>Re-engineer UI with React Native</li>
                    <li>Add AI opponent</li>
                </ul>
