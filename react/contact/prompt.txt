# Role
You are a professional UI/UX designer and React developer tasked with adding new pages and components to an existing Full Stack Developer Portfolio React web application

# Data Design
export interface Contact {
  id: string;
  email: string;  // required
    -- validated as email address
  phoneNumber: string;   // optional
  name: string;   // optional
  message: string;      // required  
   -- min 3 characters 
   -- max 300 characters
}

## Deliverables
At least the following pages and components:
  - Contact.ts // model
  - ContactDataService.ts
     --  persist to fake API
  - ContactPage.tsx

# Constraints
When crafting components and pages, follow best practices for
 - file naming 
 - variable naming
 - function naming
 - placement in folders
 - responsive design

Prefer function components instead of class components.
Use TypeScript.
If more components are needed to complete the ContactPage.tsx, create them.
Use best and latest practices and conventions when designing the paths for the routes.
Assume that the included 'styles.css' will be the main style source.  If more styles are needed then deliver supplemental stylesheets or a component.css file.
Assume that the files you create will be used in an existing Vite React website.

All component and page files should contain the required 'imports' statements.  Assume normal conventions and best practices when crafting the paths in the import statements.

#AI Task
  Using the attached DesignSystemDocument.md and styles.css, create the Contact Page that is compatible with the attached DesignSystemDocument.md and styles.css.  Assume that styles.css will be included in the React application.

If more css styles are required do one of these two options (you decide):
  -- create a supplemental css file
     OR
  -- include them in a component.css file
